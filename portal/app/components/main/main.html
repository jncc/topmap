    <p class="lede">This service is in development it should only be used by members of the development team and user group</p>

        This service is a light-weight tool through which to quickly explore spatial 
        data offered through an OGC compliant web service primarily through its WMS 
        (Web Mapping Service). It was developed by the Joint Nature Conservation 
        Committee as part of the drive to offer an easy way to access and manage
        our spatial data holdings. This portal has been created to manage Earth
        Observation Datasets and deliver them to interested parties either via OGC
        web-services (WMS, WFS, WCS, etc...) or via direct download where possible.

        This service is still under development and feedback is appreciated while
        we develop this service.
