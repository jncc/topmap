            Users should be aware that this is not yet a production system and 
            consequently, no end user support is available. This node currently 
            serves solely to support a number of EODIP projects through data 
            provision and access. However the scope of the node’s service is 
            likely to expand over the year.

                It is intended that users will soon be able to set-up processing 
                within the node, rather than downloading the data for local 
                processing. There are also plans for large scale data processing 
                through node to node transfer, for example for processing all of 
                the available satellite data on a regular schedule.
